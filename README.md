Activation Dynamic analysis:
**1) Neural Network:**
I have taken 3 layer neural network
1st layer contains 728  neuron second contains 128 neuron and third contains 10 neuron.
This nural network contain one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer.
Results of sigmoid has been extracted in this notebook. 

**Activation Functions**

1) sigmoid
2) tanh
3) tanh+sin
The testing accuracy for these activation functions are as follow:
      sigmoid:  77.75%
      tanh:     83.36
      sin+tanh: 84.35%
